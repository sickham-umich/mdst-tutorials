Hi! my name is Seth Wickham.

I am a Senior, however I transferred in last year and I will be taking a 5th year.

I will be majoring in Economics and Data Science through LSA. 

A fun fact about me is that I'm currently a member of the Michigan wrestling and triathlon clubs.
I have wrestled since 7th grade and I'm just now getting into the triathlon world!
